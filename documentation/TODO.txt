- Redesign so that TextMaker gets with parameters are testable
- Refactor PlayCharacter moving common code to other classes
- Reconsider TextMaker's API
- Target not found message requires a parameter (directed say)
- Characters should have an output Queue (their connection's queue)...ultimately mobiles will too.
- Players should have an output Queue (their connection's queue)?
- Should we bother piling the commands on for ambiguous? Should it simply be the case that we pile up a list of
  command displays?
- ComponentCollection idea
- ConnectionInitializer needs better testing
