- Reconsider 'commandClass' probably should just be commandIdentifier? commandName?
- Handle Unknown command in PlayCharacter
- Handle Ambiguous command in PlayCharacter
- Should we bother piling the commands on for ambiguous? Should it simply be the case that we pile up a list of
  command displays?
- ComponentCollection idea
- ConnectionInitializer needs better testing
